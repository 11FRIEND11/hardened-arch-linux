# Hardened Arch Linux  (On a virtual machine)

## Welcome to My Arch Journey  

Hello, I am **11FRIEND11**, and this repository is where I document my journey of transforming vanilla Arch Linux into the **ultimate hacking OS**.  

I've used **Kali** and **Parrot** before, but after a while, they felt kinda plain. I wanted something that was truly **my own**, built from the ground up, customized exactly the way I like it. And i decided to use **Arch Linux** for this.

## **Why Arch and Not Linux From Scratch (LFS)?**  
My goal was to create **Linux from scratch**, but going straight to LFS felt like **jumping off a cliff without a parachute**. Arch, on the other hand, sits in the perfect middle ground—  
✅ Harder than beginner-friendly distros like Kali & Parrot  
✅ Easier than extreme builds like LFS  
✅ Gives full control while still having a package manager (**pacman**)  

With Arch, I get to **customize everything from scratch** while still having enough structure to make things work without spending a lifetime configuring every single package manually.  

## **Project Goals 🏆**  
✅ Install Arch Linux in **VirtualBox** and document every step  
✅ Set up a **lightweight but powerful** hacking environment  
✅ Install and categorize **hacking tools** (Recon, Exploitation, Password Cracking, etc.)  
✅ Apply **security and privacy hardening**  
✅ Make the system **look and feel amazing**  

## **A Well Known And Funny Thing About Arch Users...**  
You know you’ve met an Arch user when—no matter the situation,they will let you know they use Arch. Even at your **grandmother’s funeral**, they'll lean in and whisper:  
> *"I use Arch btw."*  

Stay tuned for updates as I build **Hardened Arch Linux!**
