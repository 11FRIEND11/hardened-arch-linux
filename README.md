# Hardened Arch Linux  

## Welcome to My Arch Journey

Hello, I am **11FRIEND11**, and this repository is where I document my journey of transforming vanilla Arch Linux into the **ultimate hacking OS**.  

I've used **Kali** and **Parrot** before, but after a while, they felt too boring. I wanted something that was truly **my own**—built from the ground up, customized exactly the way I like it. And what better OS to take on this challenge than **Arch Linux**?  

Arch has a reputation for being **one of the hardest OSes to master**, and I’m here to give it a try while sharing everything I learn along the way. If you’re also looking to craft your own personal hacking distro, this repo might be helpful.  

## A Funny Thing About Arch Users...  
You know you’ve met an Arch user when—no matter the situation—they will let you know they use Arch. Even at your **grandmother’s funeral**, they'll lean in and whisper:  
> *"btw, I use Arch."*  

Stay tuned for updates as I set up **Hardened Arch Linux!**
