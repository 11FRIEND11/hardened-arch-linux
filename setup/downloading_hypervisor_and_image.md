# Where to Get the ISO and VirtualBox  

This is where I will help you download the **ISO** (image file) needed for the setup and also the **hypervisor** (virtualbox) that we will use to create the virtual machine.

## **Hypervisor: Oracle VM VirtualBox**  

We will be using **Oracle VM VirtualBox** as our hypervisor.  

### **How to Install VirtualBox**  
1. Go to [www.virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org)  
2. Under **VirtualBox Platform Packages**, select the version for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
3. After it is downloaded, click the `.exe` (Windows) or equivalent installer to install it on your computer.  
4. Download the **Extension Pack** from their website for better compatibility and features.
  
My current version: 7.1.4 r165100 (Qt6.5.3)
